This document tracks the history and evolution of the **Open Data Contract Standard**.

# v3.0.0 - 2024-xx-xx - IN PROGRESS

* Fundamentals:
  * Rename uuid to id
  * Add name
  * Rename quantumName to dataProduct and make it optional
  * Rename datasetDomain to domain (we avoid the dataset prefix)
  * Drop datasetKind (example: virtualDataset, was optional, have not seen any   * usage)
  * Drop userConsumptionMode (examples: analytical, was optional, already   * deprecated in v2.)
  * Drop sourceSystem (example: bigQuery, information will be encoded in servers)
  * Drop sourcePlatform (example: googleCloudPlatform, information will be encoded   * in servers)
  * Drop productSlackChannel (will move to support channels)
  * Drop productFeedbackUrl (will move to support channels)
  * Drop productDl (will move to support channels)
  * Drop username (credentials should not be stored in the data contract)
  * Drop password (credentials should not be stored in the data contract)
  * Drop driverVersion (will move to servers if needed)
  * Drop driver (will move to servers if needed)
  * Drop server (will move to servers if needed)
  * Drop project (BigQuery-specific, will move to servers)
  * Drop datasetName (BigQuery-specific, will move to servers)
  * Drop database (BigQuery-specific, will move to servers)
  * Drop schedulerAppName (not part of the contract)
* Schema:
  * Major changes, check spec. 
  * Adds support for non table formats, hierarchies, and arrays.
  * `priorTableName` is not supported anymore, if needed, consider a custom property.
  * `dataGranularity` is now `dataGranularityDescription`.
  * `encryptedColumnName`is now `encryptedName`.
  * `partitionStatus` is now `partitioned`.
  * 'clusterStatus' is not supported anymore, if needed, consider a custom property.
  * 'clusterKeyPosition' is not supported anymore, if needed, consider a custom property.
  * 'sampleValues' is now 'examples'.
  * 'isNullable' is now 'required'.
  * 'isUnique' is now 'unique'.
  * 'isPrimaryKey' is now 'primaryKey'.
  * 'criticalDataElementStatus' is now 'criticalDataElement'.
  * 'clusterKeyPosition' is not supported anymore, if needed, consider a custom property.
* Data Quality:
  *
* Pricing:
  * No changes.
* Team:
  * Replaces `stakeholders`. Content stays the same.
* Security:
  * No changes.
* SLA:
  * Starting with v3, the schema is not purely tables and columns, hence minor modifications: columns are now elements.
  * 'slaDefaultColumn' is now 'slaDefaultElement'.
  * 'column' is now 'element'.
  * Explicit reference to Data QoS.
* Custom and other properties:
  * 'systemInstance' is not supported anymore, if needed, consider a custom property.


# v2.2.2 - 2024-05-23 - APPROVED

* In JSON schema validation:
  * Change `dataset.description` data type from `array` to `string`.
  * Change `dataset.column.isPrimaryKey` data type from `string` to `boolean`.
  * Change `price.priceAmount` data type from `string` to `number`.
  * Change `slaProperties.value` data type from `string` to `oneOf[string, number]`.
  * Change `slaProperties.valueExt` data type from `string` to `oneOf[string, number]`.
* Update [examples](docs/examples) to adhere to JSON schema.
* Full example from README directs to [full-example.yaml](docs/examples/all/full-example.yaml).
* Add in mkdocs for creating a [documentation website](https://bitol-io.github.io/open-data-contract-standard/). Check [building-doc.md](building-doc.md).
* Add vendors page [vendors.md](vendors.md). Feel free to add anyone there.

# v2.2.1 - 2023-12-18 - APPROVED

* Reformat quality examples to be valid YAML.
* Type of definition for authority have standard values: `businessDefinition`, `transformationImplementation`, `videoTutorial`, `tutorial`, and `implementation`.
* Add in `isUnique`, `primaryKeyPosition`, `partitionKeyPosition`, and `clusterKeyPosition` to `column` definition.
* Add [JSON schema](https://github.com/bitol-io/open-data-contract-standard/blob/main/schema/odcs-json-schema.json) to validate YAML files for v2.2.1.
* Integrated as part of [Bitol](https://lfaidata.foundation/projects/bitol/).
* Reformat Markdown tables.

# v2.2.0 - 2023-07-27 - APPROVED

* New name to Open Data Contract Standard.
* `templateName` is now called `standardVersion`, v2.2.0 parsers should account for this change and support both to avoid a breaking change.
* Added support for `authoritativeDefinitions` at the table level.
* Added many examples.
* Various improvements and typo corrections.
* Finalization of fork under AIDA User Group.

# v2.1.1 - 2023-04-26 - APPROVED

* Open source version.
* Additional value field `valueExt` in SLA.

# v2.1.0 - 2023-03-23 - APPROVED

## Data Quality
The data contract adds elements specifically for interfacing with the Data Quality tooling. 

Additions:
* quality (table level & column level check):
* templateName (called standardVersion since v2.2.0)
* dimension
* type
* severity
* businessImpact
* scheduleCronExpression 
* customProperties
* columns
* isPrimaryKey

## Physical names
The data contract is a logical construct; we add more specific links to the physical world.

## Service-level agreement
The service-level agreements not previously used are more detailed to follow the DP QoS pattern. See SLA.

## Other
Removed the weight for system ratings from the data contract. Their default values remain.

# v2.0.0 - SUPERSEED BY V2.1.0

## Guidelines & Evolution
* [Type case](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsoncstyleguide.xml?showone=Property_Name_Format#Property_Name_Format)
